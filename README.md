## Overview

This educational tool breaks down complex quantum computing concepts into digestible, interactive lessons. Through 20 progressive steps across 7 chapters, users learn about:

- **Classical Computing**: Bits, binary representation, and ASCII encoding
- **Quantum Fundamentals**: Qubits and the Bloch sphere
- **Quantum Properties**: Superposition and measurement
- **Quantum Gates**: X, H, and Z gate operations
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Creating and measuring entangled qubits
- **Quantum Advantage**: Why quantum computing matters and real-world applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- No installation or build process required!

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secret_lives_of_quantum.git
   cd secret_lives_of_quantum
   ```

2. Open the application:
   - **Option 1**: Double-click `index.html` in your file explorer
   - **Option 2**: From the command line:
     ```bash
     # On macOS
     open index.html
     
     # On Linux
     xdg-open index.html
     
     # On Windows
     start index.html
     ```

3. That's it! The application will open in your default browser.

### Using a Local Web Server (Optional)

For the best experience, you can serve the file using a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Journey**: The tutorial begins automatically with classical computing concepts
2. **Interactive Learning**: Click "Try It" to interact with each concept and see immediate results
3. **Navigate**: Use "Next Step" and "Previous Step" buttons to move through lessons
4. **Progress Tracking**: Watch the progress bar and "Step X of 20" indicator
5. **Experiment**: Many visualizations are interactive - click on qubits, gates, and other elements

### Learning Path

The tutorial progresses through 7 chapters:

1. **Classical Computing** (Steps 1-3): Understanding bits and binary
2. **Introduction to Quantum** (Steps 4-7): The Bloch sphere and quantum states
3. **Quantum Qubits** (Step 8): Transitioning from theory to practice
4. **Quantum Gates** (Steps 9-12): X, H, and Z gate operations
5. **Quantum Measurement** (Steps 13-14): Superposition collapse and randomness
6. **Quantum Entanglement** (Steps 15-16): Creating and measuring entangled qubits
7. **Quantum Advantage** (Steps 17-19): Real-world applications and why quantum matters
